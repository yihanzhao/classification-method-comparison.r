Here is a comparison between LDA, QDA and KNN on a dataset "Auto" in the library of ISLR. 
The test error rate for LDA predictor based on the model predicted is 9.69%.
The test error rate for QDA predictor based on the model predicted is 7.65%.
The test error rate for logistic regression based on the model predicted in is 9.69%.
For KNN, the error rate is 14.29% when k=1, 10.20% when k=5, 12.24% when k=10, 9.69% when k=50, and 10.71% when k=100. 
Thus, when k=50, kNN performs best among these five trials.
